# My Website

This repo contains the really basic HTML and CSS I use to power my personal webpage, and some of my static projects.

## Deploying

When I make changes to the HTML or the static files, I can run the following command to sync the project directory with my s3 bucket:

	$ ./deploy.sh [email]
